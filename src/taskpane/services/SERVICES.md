## AgentService

The `AgentService` is the central service that processes user messages and coordinates communication between the user interface and the Excel backend.

### Input
- User messages (text strings) from the chat interface

### Process
1. Receives a message from the user
2. Processes the message to determine the user's intent
3. For read operations, directly reads from Excel and formats the output
4. For other operations, sends the message to the AI agent backend (currently simulated)
5. Receives a response from the AI agent
6. Processes the AI agent's response to extract actions
7. Executes the actions using the ExcelActionExecutor
8. Formats the output in a user-friendly way

### Output
- A response object containing:
  - A message to display to the user (formatted for readability)
  - A body field for structured content (e.g., formatted tables, rich text)
  - Actions to be performed in Excel
  - Metadata about the response

### Key Methods
- `processMessage(message: string)`: Processes a user message and returns a response
- `sendMessageToAIAgent(message: string)`: Sends a message to the AI agent and receives a response
- `processAIAgentResponse(response: AIAgentResponse)`: Processes a response from the AI agent and executes the actions
- `formatWorksheetOutput(values: any[][])`: Formats worksheet data in a user-friendly way

### Output Formatting
The AgentService now formats the output in a more user-friendly way:
- For read operations, it shows only populated cells with their addresses and values
- Empty cells are skipped to reduce clutter
- Complex objects are properly stringified
- The output is formatted as a list of cells with their values
- The formatted output is placed in the "body" field of the response

## ExcelService

The `ExcelService` is responsible for interacting with Excel using both ExcelJS and the Office.js API.

### Input
- Commands to read from or write to Excel
- Cell addresses, ranges, and values

### Process
1. Initializes a connection to Excel using the Office.js API
2. Maintains a local ExcelJS workbook for caching and manipulation
3. Uses the Office.js API for direct read/write operations to Excel
4. Synchronizes the local ExcelJS workbook with the actual Excel document

### Output
- Results of Excel operations (e.g., cell values, range data)
- Confirmation of successful operations

### Key Methods
- `getCurrentWorksheet()`: Gets the current worksheet using the Office.js API
- `writeToCell(address: string, value: any)`: Writes a value to a cell using the Office.js API
- `writeToRange(address: string, values: any[][])`: Writes values to a range using the Office.js API
- `getSelectedRange()`: Gets the selected range using the Office.js API

### Integration with Office.js
The ExcelService now uses the Office.js API directly for reading and writing data from Excel. This is done through:
- Direct calls to `Excel.run()` for operations
- Helper functions in taskpane.ts (`readCell`, `readRange`) for common operations
- Synchronization between the local ExcelJS workbook and the actual Excel document

## ExcelActionExecutor

The `ExcelActionExecutor` is responsible for executing Excel actions based on the protocol defined in `ExcelActionProtocol.ts`.

### Input
- A list of `ExcelAction` objects from the AI agent

### Process
1. Receives a list of actions from the AI agent
2. Executes each action in sequence
3. Handles different types of actions (e.g., writing to cells, creating pivot tables)
4. Logs the execution of actions (in the current implementation)

### Output
- Confirmation of successful execution of actions
- Error messages if actions fail

### Key Methods
- `executeActions(actions: ExcelAction[])`: Executes a list of actions
- `executeAction(action: ExcelAction)`: Executes a single action
- Various methods for executing specific types of actions (e.g., `executeWriteCell`, `executeWriteRange`)

## ExcelActionProtocol

The `ExcelActionProtocol` defines the protocol for communication between the backend AI agent and the Excel frontend.

### Input
- None (this is a protocol definition, not a service)

### Process
- Defines interfaces and types for the protocol
- Specifies the structure of messages and actions

### Output
- TypeScript interfaces and types that can be used by other services

### Key Interfaces
- `AIAgentResponse`: The structure of a response from the AI agent
  - `message`: A message to display to the user
  - `body`: Optional formatted body content to display in the chat
  - `actions`: A list of actions to perform
  - `metadata`: Optional metadata about the response
- `ExcelAction`: A single action to be performed in Excel
- `ExcelActionType`: The types of actions that can be performed
- Various data types for specific actions (e.g., `WriteCellData`, `WriteRangeData`)

## Service Interaction Flow

The following diagram illustrates how the services interact with each other:

```
User -> Chat.tsx -> AgentService -> AI Agent Backend
                                      |
                                      v
ExcelActionExecutor <- ExcelActionProtocol <- AIAgentResponse
       |
       v
ExcelService -> Excel (via Office.js API)
```

### Detailed Flow

1. The user sends a message through the chat interface (`Chat.tsx`).
2. The message is processed by the `AgentService`.
3. For read operations, the `AgentService` directly reads from Excel and formats the output.
4. For other operations, the `AgentService` sends the message to the AI agent backend.
5. The AI agent backend returns a response in the format defined by `ExcelActionProtocol`.
6. The `AgentService` processes the response and passes the actions to the `ExcelActionExecutor`.
7. The `ExcelActionExecutor` executes the actions using the `ExcelService`.
8. The `ExcelService` performs the operations in Excel using the Office.js API.
9. The results are displayed to the user through the chat interface in a formatted way.

### Example Flow

1. User: "Write the value 42 to cell A1"
2. `AgentService` processes the message and sends it to the AI agent.
3. AI agent returns a response with an action to write to cell A1.
4. `AgentService` passes the action to the `ExcelActionExecutor`.
5. `ExcelActionExecutor` calls `ExcelService.writeToCell("A1", 42)`.
6. `ExcelService` uses the Office.js API to write the value 42 to cell A1 in Excel.
7. The result is displayed to the user: "I've written the value '42' to cell A1".
